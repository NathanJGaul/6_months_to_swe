# BigO Notation and Algorithm Complexity

## BigO Notation
Simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency

1. Complexity in terms of input size, N
2. Machine-independent
3. Basic computer steps
4. Time & space

### Complexity Case

* **word-case**: most often used for BigO
* best-case
* average-case

This does not mean best and average-cases do not have there use.

### General Rules

1. Ignore constants: `5n -> O(n)`
2. Certain termas "dominate" others: `O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)`
